## Site information

This blog serves mostly as a learning platform for myself, I find describing the concepts I'm learning is helpful. Hopefully, through this I can give back to the community I rely on for learning.

### Technical Details

The site is generated with Jekyll and hosted by Github through their Pages feature, so all the sources for the blog is openly available at <https://github.com/sturla22/sturla22.github.io>

### Privacy Policy
_This privacy policy is based on the policy suggested [here](https://www.kevel.co/blog/gdpr-google-analytics/)._

This site uses Google Analytics for aggregated, anonymized website traffic analysis. In order to track your session usage, Google drops a cookie (\_ga) with a randomly-generated ClientID in your browser. This ID is anonymized and contains no identifiable information like email, phone number, name, etc. This site also sends Google your IP Address. It uses GA to track aggregated website behavior, such as what pages you looked at, for how long, and so on. This information is important to me for improving the user experience and determining site effectiveness. If you would like to access what browsing information I have - or ask me to delete any GA data - please delete your \_ga cookies, reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sturla-lange) with your ClientID (see how to find it below), and/or install the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Finding your ClientID
To find your ClientID, you’ll need to go to your browser’s settings and manually look at what cookies are stored. You should find one named \_ga, which is the Google Analytics cookie, and within it is a string like GA1.2-2.318596131.1556642125, your ClientID is the "318596131.1556642125" part.
