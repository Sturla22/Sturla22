GHDL is "a VHDL analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental) synthesizer that can process (nearly) any VHDL design."

## Installing

You can find GHDL's comprehensive documentation on [readthedocs](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html).

### Ubuntu

 1. `sudo apt install ghdl`
 2. Open a terminal and try `ghdl -v` to check that your installation was successful

### Windows

  1. Go to the [overview of pre-built packages](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting/Releases.html#downloading-pre-built-packages) and download the zip for Windows
  2. Extract the files in the zip
  3. Add the bin folder to your PATH
  4. Open cmd, powershell, or msys/git bash and run `ghdl -v` to check that your installation was successful

The remainder of this post will assume you are running on Ubuntu or a similar OS, adjust accordingly if you are running something considerably different, like Windows.

## Building and running testbenches

For a simple, one file design and a single testbench the following script will build and run the simulation:

{%
  include bash_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Script for building simple designs with a testbench"
  dir="includes/ghdl/"
  file="build_simple.sh"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Remember to set executable permissions `chmod +x build_simple.sh` and then run the script with for example:

`./build_simple.sh half_adder`

to run it on the same half adder design from [nandland](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/modules/module-half-adder.html) which I used in the [VHDL Style Guide]({% post_url 2021-03-15-vhdl-style-guide %}) post.

Due to the `set -ex` statement, which shows the commands as they are executed, the output of the script is:
```
+ ghdl -i half_adder.vhd half_adder_tb.vhd
+ ghdl -m half_adder_tb
+ ghdl -r half_adder_tb
```

You could absolutely skip the script entirely and just run these three commands directly in the terminal.

## Building libraries

In case you need a VHDL resource library, which for [PlTbUtils](https://opencores.org/projects/pltbutils) could look like this in your VHDL code:

```vhdl
library pltbutils;
  use pltbutils.txt_util.all;
```

you can build that library using the following script:

{%
  include bash_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Script for building libraries"
  dir="includes/ghdl/"
  file="buildlib.sh"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Remember to set executable permissions `chmod +x buildlib.sh` and then to build the library from source (which I have downloaded to `~/Dev/hdl/pltbutils`) you can run:

`./buildlib.sh pltbutils ~/Dev/hdl/pltbutils/trunk/src/vhdl/*.vhd`

This creates a `pltbutils-obj93.cf` in `_work` which GHDL can use as a resource library.

## Using libraries with testbenches

To direct GHDL to include the libraries placed in a certain directory we need to point to it with the `-P` option.

{%
  include bash_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Script for building simple designs that use libraries"
  dir="includes/ghdl/"
  file="build.sh"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Now, running `./build.sh half_adder_pltb` gives the output:
```
+ ghdl -i -P_work --workdir=_work half_adder_pltb.vhd half_adder_pltb_tb.vhd
+ ghdl -m -P_work --workdir=_work half_adder_pltb_tb
+ ghdl -r -P_work --workdir=_work half_adder_pltb_tb

--- START OF SIMULATION ---
Testcase: Half Adder PlTbUtils Testbench
0 fs

Test 1: Check defaults on output ports (0 fs)
Done with test 1: Check defaults on output ports (0 fs)

Test 2: Check logic (0 fs)
Done with test 2: Check logic (50000000 fs)

--- END OF SIMULATION ---
Note: the results presented below are based on the PlTbUtil's check() procedure calls.
      The design may contain more errors, for which there are no check() calls.
         50 ns
          2 Tests
          0 Skipped tests
         10 Checks
          0 Errors
*** SUCCESS ***
```

Which shows the three GHDL commands prefixed with a `+` and then the output printed to the transcript/stdout by PlTbUtils and the testbench.

## Vendor Primitives Libraries

If you make use of vendor primitives in your designs you'll need to build a library from the VHDL source files provided by the vendor.

For example, the source files for Xilinx's `unisim` library can be found in the following directory of my installation of Vivado 2020.2: `Xilinx/Vivado/2020.2/data/vhdl/src/unisims`

[GHDL provides compilation scripts for these libraries.](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting/PrecompileVendorPrimitives.html)

When building `unisim` I had a problem with using the VHDL-93 standard so I built it with the '08 standard by running:

`/usr/local/lib/ghdl/vendors/compile-xilinx-vivado.sh --vhdl2008 --unisim --source ./src`

and got the output

```
Loading environment...
Not all Xilinx primitives are VHDL-2008 compatible! Setting CONTINUE_ON_ERROR to TRUE.
[WARNING] Vendor directory '/home/sturlalange/Dev/hdl/vivado_vhdl/xilinx-vivado' already exists.
Analyzing library 'unisim'...
Creating VHDL Library 'unisim'...
Analyzing files into library 'unisim'...
  WARNING: /home/sturlalange/Dev/hdl/vivado_vhdl/src/unisims/primitive/SYSMONE4.vhd:1536:44:warning: prefix of array attribute must be an object name [-Wattribute]
  Warnings detected by filtering script.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling Xilinx Vivado libraries [SUCCESSFUL]
```

Now the library has been created in the directory `xilinx-vivado/`, it is called `unisim-obj08.cf`

We can check the contents by issuing `ghdl -d --std=08 -Pxilinx-vivado unisim` which outputs

```
# Library unisim
# Directory: xilinx-vivado/
entity xorcy_d
architecture xorcy_d_v of xorcy_d
entity xor4
architecture xor4_v of xor4
entity xor2
architecture xor2_v of xor2
entity xnor4
architecture xnor4_v of xnor4
...
```

## Conclusion

GHDL is a great alternative to proprietary simulators such as xsim and modelsim, it is actively developed and is adopting new versions of the VHDL standard, currently VHDL-2008 is partially implemented according to the [documentation](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/ImplementationOfVHDL.html#vhdl-standards).
