VUnit "features the functionality needed to realize continuous and automated testing" of HDL code.
It takes care of building, running tests (via a simulator like [GHDL]({% post_url 2021-03-25-ghdl %})) and evaluating the results. It also offers VHDL convenience procedures, functions and components as well as Verification Components. This post will cover the build/run functionality, the convenience library will be covered in a separate post.

{% include toc.html %}

## Basics

You can install VUnit with `pip instal vunit_hdl` and documentation is available [here](https://vunit.github.io/)

For a simple, one file design and a single testbench the following python script will build and run the simulation:

{%
  include python_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="VUnit run script in python"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="run.py"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Note that VUnit needs to get access to your VHDL testbench to do its magic so this is the minimum you need to add for VUnit to run your tests:
{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Basic template for VUnit testbenches"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="basic.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

After making `run.py` executable with `chmod +x run.py`, the output from running `./run.py` is:

```
{% include_relative includes/vunit/run.txt %}
```

## Configuring Compilation and Tests


I'll demonstrate configuration of tests with the same half adder design from [nandland](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/modules/module-half-adder.html) which I used in the [VHDL Style Guide]({% post_url 2021-03-15-vhdl-style-guide %}) and [GHDL]({% post_url 2021-03-25-ghdl %}) posts. To show the configuration of compilation, we'll use the VHDL-2008 standard by setting GHDL's `--std` option to `08`. The test configuration will be to inject an error into the test by setting a generic.

I have isolated the code that configures the VUnit library from the CLI code in the `Library` class, this way I can import the configuration in another python script such as in an [Invoke](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) script, example [here](#invoke-example).

{%
  include python_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Configuring with VUnit"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="run_vunit.py"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

On the last line of `configure_run` I've used a generic `fail` by calling [add\_config](https://vunit.github.io/py/vunit.html#vunit.ui.test.Test.add_config) on the `logic` test to demonstrate how to configure tests and as a byproduct: to show the appearance of failing tests in VUnit. I could have used [lib.set\_generic](https://vunit.github.io/py/vunit.html#vunit.ui.library.Library.set_generic), but that sets the generic for all tests and I would have to run the python script several times with different arguments, perhaps leveraging VUnit's [custom CLI arguments](https://vunit.github.io/py/ui.html#adding-custom-command-line-arguments) recipe. However, by adding a test configuration VUnit runs the test twice, once for each configuration I've told it about.

Expand the "VHDL tesbench code" below for a look at the VHDL code that is being tested. Here I've made use of VUnit's [multiple test case recipe](https://vunit.github.io/user_guide.html#id5) as well.

{% capture details %}
{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Half Adder VUnit testbench"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="half_adder_tb.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html details=details summary="VHDL testbench code" %}

Running the python script with `./run_vunit.py` results in

```
{% include_relative includes/vunit/run_vunit.txt %}
```

As you can see from the summary section of the output, the logic test runs twice and fails in the second attempt as expected since the `fail` generic has been set to `True`. You can also see that VUnit is running this with GHDL since the error message comes from `/usr/local/bin/ghdl`. Running the python script with the arguments `--clean -v` will show you the compilation and run commands that VUnit issues on your behalf.

## Invoke example

With Invoke I can automate numerous tasks that depend on CLI or python interfaces. In the following script I set VUnits output directory to `_work`.

{%
  include python_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Invoke tasks definition using VUnit"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="tasks.py"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Having installed Invoke with `pip install invoke` I can run `inv run` to execute this task.

## CI example

VUnit offers XUnit output in xml format which can be easily integrated with CI tools like Gitlab CI or Jenkins. To instruct VUnit to create an xml file we provide the `-x` argument and a filename: `./run.py -x results.xml`

### Gitlab

Gitlab offers CI on shared runners for free accounts, it requires a yaml specification in a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`

{%
  include yaml_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Gitlab CI configuration"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="gitlab-ci.yml"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

**Note**: Don't forget to set your VUnit python script to be executable with `chmod +x run_vunit.py`, even on windows, where you might need to do something like `git update-index --chmod=+x run_vunit.py` before pushing to gitlab.

Gitlab even provides an overview of the number of tests and their results based on the XUnit output.

{%
  include image.html
  dir="/assets/img/"
  file="vunit_ci_gitlab.png"
  figure_num=figure_num
  description="Gitlab Results"
%}
{% assign figure_num = figure_num | plus: 1 %}


### Github

According to [VUnit's documentation](https://vunit.github.io/ci/script.html#github-actions) the following yaml should work for github:

{%
  include yaml_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Github Actions configuration"
  dir="includes/vunit/"
  file="github_action.yml"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

As far as I can see, there is no official support for XUnit result parsing on Github.

## XUnit-Viewer

[Xunit Viewer](https://github.com/lukejpreston/xunit-viewer) can generate HTML from XUnit results files.

See [example output here](/assets/html/vunit_xunit_viewer.html).

## Conclusion

The build/run functionality of VUnit is a great abstraction of this otherwise tedious process, the results parsing helps you focus on the important output and to discard the uninteresting parts, such as long command lines which executed successfully. Getting a CI process up and running in 7 lines of yaml is pretty impressive too!
